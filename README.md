# NameZero

NameZero - is a firmware for ESP32 family devices. This firmware until not ready for usage, but I'm working on it. It will include a Sub-GHZ, IR, BruteForcing, RFID(NFC and 125khz Reader/Writer/Emulator), WiFi Attacks, BLE Attacks, BadUSB, third party applications and much more.

# How to install this?

Until the firmware is [released](https://github.com/Xelbor/NameZero/releases), I dont publish `.bin` files, but you can build it yourself.

At this point in time, the firmware has only been tested on CardPuter. In subsequent releases, separate firmware files for other devices will be introduced.

# Communication
Also, if have a desire to help and have other devices from M5Stack or Lilygo(t-embed and other), then I ask you help me with testing firmware(xelbor45hail@gmail.com). Thanks!
