# NameZero

NameZero - is a firmware for Esp32 family devices. This firmware until not ready for usage, but I'm working on it. It will include a Sub-GHZ, IR, BruteForcing, RFID(NFC and 125khz Reader/Writer/Emulator), WiFi Attacks, BLE Attacks, BadUSB and much more.

# How to install this?

Until the firmware is [released](https://github.com/Xelbor/NameZero/releases), I dont publish `.bin` files. You can build it yourself.

At this point in time, the firmware has only been tested on CardPuter. In subsequent releases, separate firmware files for other devices will be introduced.
